Issue: forcing scene saving during sending out (with linked files)

Description:
To pack external files in another blend, the script saves the current blend before opening another one.
Might be a problem if the user doesn't want to overwrite his blend.

Possible solution:
This is a more general issue - any changes introduced to the scene by the RayPump's script is unwanted
from the user's point of view (e.g. 'fixing textures', packing files, changing linked data status, messing with
undo stack, ...).

One of ways to avoid those issues could be:
- save a copy of the current scene;
- launch another Blender process (console only, managed by the RayPump);
- make all necessary changes inside the copy and then send it to the farm;

That way user's scene stays intact. 

Possible drawbacks: bigger scenes can cause memory issues (two Blender copies in RAM)

Issue: running the script alters the scene history

Description:
User can get confused with double entries in both File->Open Recent... and splash screen 'Recent' section. Those are side effect of RayPump's script saving
the scene in BUFFER directory. Any idea to keep those entries hidden?
